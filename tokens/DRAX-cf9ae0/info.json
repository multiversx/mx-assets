    "description": "In the mystical lands of MultiversX, where the skies shimmered with starlight and magic filled the air, Roxy wandered gracefully, captivating all with her presence. She explored the dense forests on the edge of the land and discovered an ancient shrine adorned with dragon carvings. Upon touching the carvings, a blinding light enveloped her, and a resonant voice declared her the chosen one. \nDRAX, the guardian dragon of MultiversX, materialized, offering his protection and strength. Together, Roxy and DRAX vowed to protect the MultiversX land and embark on great quests.",
