Enter $GRINCH, the greenest, grinchiest, and most gloriously grouchy token on the blockchain. Inspired by everyone's favorite holiday heist artist, $GRINCH is here to bring some sarcasm and sass to the meme coin market.  \n\nThis isn't just another \"to the moon\" coin—$GRINCH is \"to Mount Crumpit and beyond!\" We’re not promising you a Lambo, but hey, maybe a sleigh pulled by an underfed dog. Our roadmap? It’s just a list of things we *might* do… if we’re feeling festive.  \n\nSo, what’s in it for you? A chance to hoard tokens like the Grinch hoarded Christmas cheer. And when your heart grows three sizes from all the laughs (or maybe the gains), just remember—this is the coin that stole Christmas, and then gave it back… for a 2% transaction fee.  \n\n**$GRINCH: Because who needs Whoville when you’ve got a wallet full of memes?**",
