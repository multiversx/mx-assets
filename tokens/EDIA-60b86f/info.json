    "description": "Edia is the ecosystem token of Wavenode, powered by “Burning Days” and community rewards. On Burning Days, 100% of the protocol rewards are used to buy Edia on the market and permanently burn it, reducing supply in a fully transparent way. In addition, Edia is regularly gifted to people who stake with Wavenode as a community reward, and holders can also earn Edia by staking a Wdiamond NFT. The long-term goal is to build a scarcer, community-driven token that supports the growth of the validator ecosystem.",
