    "description": "The Faceless Many is a collection of 8064 randomly generated NFTs built on Elrond Network. They represent the hero in each of us — common people united in the extraordinary effort to write a new financial future. Holding a Faceless Many NFT earns you $REVP (revPoints), which can be used to purchase virtually anything — from NFTs and presale spots to merch, EGLD prizes, and physical items. That’s why we call it a 5–in-1 NFT.",
