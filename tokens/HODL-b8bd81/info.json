    "description": "HodlTokenClub was created to disturb the way tokens and rewards are distributed in the blockchain space. We noticed that most wealthy investors capture the majority of rewards leaving dust to the smallest investors in the market. Hold Club is here to change that and our solution is simple, yet unique in the blockchain space.  Our economic model based on random tokens and rewards distribution enables both parties to get return on investment over the time. Hold Club is truly community owned business as its wealth is shared among investors through very first ESDT shares on Elrond Network leveraging $HODL token which is fully backed by LP position on xExchange and therefore fully community owned as 90% of supply is distributed using HodlClubNFTs collection.",
