# Introduction

This repository holds a list of whitelisted tokens in the MultiversX web tools. A whitelisted token can have website and socials URLs, a logo or a description, that will be displayed on MultiversX products, such as the MultiversX Explorer or the Web Wallet. The logos are also used in the xPortal App.

# Custom ESDT logo & description
Amplify your brand via the MultiversX Network web tools & the Mobile Wallet.

Add a logo, description & socials for your ESDT token.

Project owners can create a PR to this repo. Create a folder named exactly as your ESDT ID or NFT Collection ID, i.e. TOKEN-abcc123. Add 2 files for the logo: logo.png and logo.svg. Also add an info.json file containing all the relevant information, as following:

## info.json

Here’s a prefilled template for the .json file to get you started:

```JSON
{
    "website": "https://www.multiversxtoken.com",
    "description": "The EGLD token is the utility token of MultiversX Token",
    "ledgerSignature": "1234",
    "social": {
        "email": "egld-token@multiversx.com",
        "blog": "https://www.multiversxtoken.com/EGLD-token-blog",
        "twitter": "https://twitter.com/EGLD-token-twitter",
        "whitepaper": "https://www.multiversxtoken.com/EGLD-token-whitepaper.pdf",
        "coinmarketcap": "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/EGLD-token",
        "coingecko": "https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/EGLD-token"
    },
    "lockedAccounts": {
        "egld1alice": "Team vesting",
        "egld1bob": "Locked private sale"
    },
    "extraTokens": [
        "LPTOKEN-1234",
        "STAKED-1234"
    ],
    "status": "active"
}
```

- `ledgerSignature` will be generated by MultiversX. It will give your token “whitelist” status on the Ledger app and enable a more data rich flow for users storing your token on their Ledger hardware wallets. If one wants to set a Ledger signature, request it when opening a PR.
- `lockedAccounts` defines accounts that do not actively transfer tokens, which will be subtracted from the supply to determine the circulating supply of the token
- `extraTokens` defines tokens / MetaESDT collection identifiers that are part of the token itself (LP tokens, Farm tokens, Metastaking tokens, etc). These extra tokens will be also taken into consideration when calculating distinct `accounts` & total number of `transactions` in the token details API endpoint

## Guidelines:
- logo does not resemble MultiversX/Mobile Wallet logos, or other trademarked visual identities
- PR files need to be named info.json, logo.svg and logo.png
- the PR title has to be the token name + identifier (ex: TOKEN-abc123)
- projects need to have a minimum of 1000 token holders and token transactions
- projects need to have a minimum of 1000+ Twitter, Discord or TG official channel followers
- projects need to have a working website
- max pic size 100kb (.png)

## Logos general requirements

- must look good also when cropped as a circle
- must define a transparent background
- must have sufficiently good contrast both when rendered on a light background, as well as a dark background

## logo.png
