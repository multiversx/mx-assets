# Introduction

This repository holds a list of whitelisted tokens in the Elrond web tools. A whitelisted token can have website and socials URLs, a logo or a description, that will be displayed on Elrond products, such as the Elrond Explorer or the Web Wallet. The logos are also used in the Maiar App.

# Custom ESDT logo & description
Amplify your brand via the Elrond Network web tools & the Maiar App.

Add a logo, description & socials for your ESDT token.

Project owners can create a PR to this repo. Create a folder named exactly as your ESDT ID or NFT Collection ID, i.e. TOKEN-abcc123. Add 2 files for the logo: logo.png and logo.svg. Also add an info.json file containing all the relevant information, as following:

## info.json

Here’s a prefilled template for the .json file to get you started:

```JSON

        "erd1bob": "Locked private sale"
    },

    ],
    "status": "active"
}
```

- `ledgerSignature` will be generated by Elrond. It will give your token “whitelist” status on the Ledger app and enable a more data rich flow for users storing your token on their Ledger hardware wallets. If one wants to set a Ledger signature, request it when opening a PR.
- `lockedAccounts` defines accounts that do not actively transfer tokens, which will be subtracted from the supply to determine the circulating supply of the token
- `extraTokens` defines tokens / MetaESDT collection identifiers that are part of the token itself (LP tokens, Farm tokens, Metastaking tokens, etc). These extra tokens will be also taken into consideration when calculating distinct `accounts` & total number of `transactions` in the token details API endpoint
