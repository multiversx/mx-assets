  "description": "The XOXNO Accumulator serves as the central hub for XOXNO liquid stakers' utility. This smart contract aggregates $XOXNO tokens and other assets, including eGLD, from various platform activities such as market fees, launchpad fees, lending/borrowing interest and liquidation fees, eGLD liquid staking, and NFT ticketing. At the end of each day, the contract converts all accumulated tokens to $XOXNO by purchasing them from the open market (xExchange). The acquired $XOXNO tokens are then distributed as rewards to the XOXNO: Real Yield Staking, allocated to the treasury, and partially burned. Additionally, it collects all creator royalties, which are distributed and auto-compounded daily.",
