  "name": "Liquorix: AI Yield Reactor",
  "description": "An autonomous yield reactor built on MultiversX that acts as a strategy layer over xLend. The protocol accepts EGLD and xEGLD (Xoxno’s Liquid Staking Token), utilizing an AI-driven loop to borrow stablecoins and leverage positions. By automatically managing collateral ratios and executing leverage/deleverage cycles to accumulate more EGLD, the reactor maximizes lending APY while actively monitoring risk factors to protect capital.",
